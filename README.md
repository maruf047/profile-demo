# profile-demo

This is a demo version of a authentication system (in progress)

To run this project you will need NodeJs, MongoDB, ExpressJS & AngularJS.

If you have NodeJS installed then you will also need to run this project:

express (windows shell:  "npm install express --save")
express-controller (windows shell:  "npm install express-controller --save")
body-parser (windows shell:  "npm install body-parser --save")
mongooser (windows shell:  "npm install mongoose --save")

MongoDB usually runs on port 27017 in localhost. If it's not then you will need to update mongo port in "server.js"

If you use Webstorm IDE then ".idea" directory might come in handy.
